A fast URI parsing library in C. The parser is generated by ragel.
The ragel is translated from the ABNF in RFC3986:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-A
with some modifications to relax parsing for real-world.

Build dependencies are cmake, ragel, and glib.

TODO:
- documentation
- uri comparison
- uri_copy
- remove_dot_segments is pretty ugly code
